Evaluate
==========

This module contains functions for evaluating the performance of both a trained neural network by itself and in conjunction with iterative optimization.  It provides routines to plot prediced and actual lattice structures as well as to compare the predicted and actual q values that result.  It imports both :ref:`deep_d` and :ref:`fit_d`.
