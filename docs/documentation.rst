=============
Documentation is available in the ``docs`` directory.  To rebuild the documentation, run ``make html`` (``make.bat`` on Windows).  You will need to install the packages listed in ``requirements_doc.txt`` with ::

  pip install -r requirements_doc.txt

LaTeX is also required to generate math formatting.
